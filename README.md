# CRUD Code  

Please read each note very carefully!

Create a simple CRUD application with Nodejs + ExpressJS + MongoDB + (ReactJS/VueJS/Html) as front that implements the below model:
```
Customer {
	FirstName
	LastName
	DateOfBirth
	PhoneNumber
	Email
	BankAccountNumber
}
```
## Must do:

- **Best Practice**: Tdd.



### Validations (Must)

- During Create; validate the phone number to be a valid mobile number only.

- A Valid email and a valid account number must be checked before submitting the form.
- You can use [Google LibPhoneNumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) to validate number at the backend:


### Storage (Must)

- Store the phone number in a database with minimized space storage (choose varchar, or `ulong` whichever store less space).
- Email must be unique in the database

## Nice to do:
- CQRS is also a plus.
- You can use React JS or Vue JS.
- Docker-compose project that loads database and all backend and frontend services automatically with `docker-compose up`
- Clean git commits that show the work progress.
